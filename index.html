    <h1>The 0 Party</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Taking you from 0 to Hero!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>To bust the myth that IT is a rapidly-changing industry.</strong> Look around you--there's still plenty of C, FORTRAN, and COBOL code. Mark Zuckerberg supposedly still uses Emacs. Genius CS professors still make very spartan <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu" target="_blank">websites</a>. Aren't you tired of company recruiters telling you that you need to be a quick learner? What if you could graduate college (we don't believe in coding bootcamps here) knowing you'd never have to learn another programming language? What if your employment options were only determined by what you learned the past four years?
      </p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Vim or Emacs for everything, even this website.</li>
        <li>Using spaces instead of tabs, even if Vim tries to autodent our HTML</li>
	<li>Learning only 3-5 technologies, especially if they're all from the same company</li>
        <li>Diagramming everything with UML; again, even this website.</li>
      </ul>

	<h3>Sara Hahn</h3>

	<img src="imgs/SarahHahn.jpeg" width="100" class="candidate"/>
	Hey yall! My name is Sarah Hahn and I'm running for secretary of ACM! I've been programming since high school where I was taught sql and java by a man who was up in the ranks at amazon when they were considering calling it relentless. He inspired me to study Computer Science and I have increasingly grown more passionate about it every year! I would love to see the popularity of ACM grow and to have the members learn more about cyber security and related jobs.

	<h3>Cody Rivera</h3>

	<img src="imgs/CodyRivera.png" width="100" class="candidate"/>
	Cody wants to improve CS at UA by increasing the CS department and ACM's recruiting efforts, hosting Lisp tutorials to convince people that it is the best language, and spreading the joys of theoretical CS to everyone.

        <h3>Ethan Mines</h3>
	<p>
        <img src="imgs/Ethan.jpg" width="100" class="candidate"/>
        Ethan wants to change CS at UA by adding UML to the CS100 curriculum, making <a href="http://acm.cs.ua.edu" target="_blank">acm.cs.ua.edu</a> as bare-bones as this site, and holding FORTRAN workshops so our graduates can get jobs at NASA and the DoD doing maintenance programming for the rest of their lives.
