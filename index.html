    <h1>The 0 Party</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Taking you from 0 to Hero!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>To bust the myth that IT is a rapidly-changing industry.</strong> Look around you--there's still plenty of C, FORTRAN, and COBOL code. Mark Zuckerberg supposedly still uses Emacs. Genius CS professors still make very spartan <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu" target="_blank">websites</a>. Aren't you tired of company recruiters telling you that you need to be a quick learner? What if you could graduate college (we don't believe in coding bootcamps here) knowing you'd never have to learn another programming language? What if your employment options were only determined by what you learned the past four years?
      </p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Vim or Emacs for everything, even this website.</li>
        <li>Using spaces instead of tabs, even if Vim tries to autodent our HTML</li>
	<li>Learning only 3-5 technologies, especially if they're all from the same company</li>
        <li>Diagramming everything with UML; again, even this website.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Ethan Mines</h3>
	<p>
        <img src="imgs/Ethan.jpg" width="100" class="candidate"/>
        Ethan wants to change CS at UA by adding UML to the CS100 curriculum, making <a href="http://acm.cs.ua.edu" target="_blank">acm.cs.ua.edu</a> as bare-bones as this site, and holding FORTRAN workshops so our graduates can get jobs at NASA and the DoD doing maintenance programming for the rest of their lives.
